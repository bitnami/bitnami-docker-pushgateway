# What is Pushgateway?

The Prometheus Pushgateway exists to allow ephemeral and batch jobs to expose their metrics to Prometheus. Since these kinds of jobs may not exist long enough to be scraped, they can instead push their metrics to a Pushgateway. The Pushgateway then exposes these metrics to Prometheus.

# TL;DR;

```bash
$ docker run --name pushgateway bitnami/pushgateway:latest
```

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* Bitnami images are built on CircleCI and automatically pushed to the Docker Hub.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

* [`0`, `0.5.2-r7`, `latest` (0/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-pushgateway/blob/0.5.2-r7/0/Dockerfile)
* [`0-ol-7`, `0.5.2-ol-7-r3` (0/ol-7/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-pushgateway/blob/0.5.2-ol-7-r3/0/ol-7/Dockerfile)

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Pushgateway Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/pushgateway).

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/pushgateway:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/pushgateway/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/pushgateway:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```bash
$ docker build -t bitnami/pushgateway:latest https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-pushgateway.git
```

# Connecting to other containers

Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), a different server running inside a container can easily be accessed by your application containers and vice-versa.

Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname.

## Using the Command Line

### Step 1: Create a network

```bash
$ docker network create pushgateway-network --driver bridge
```

### Step 2: Launch the Blacbox_exporter container within your network

Use the `--network <NETWORK>` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the container to the `pushgateway-network` network.

```bash
$ docker run --name pushgateway-node1 --network pushgateway-network bitnami/pushgateway:latest
```

### Step 3: Run another containers

We can launch another containers using the same flag (`--network NETWORK`) in the `docker run` command. If you also set a name to your container, you will be able to use it as hostname in your network.


# Configuration

The Pushgateway has to be configured as a target to scrape by Prometheus, using one of the usual methods. However, you should always set honor_labels: true in the scrape config (see below for a detailed explanation).

[Further information](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/pushing/)

# Logging

The Bitnami pushgateway Docker image sends the container logs to the `stdout`. To view the logs:

```bash
$ docker logs pushgateway
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

# Maintenance

## Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of pushgateway, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

### Step 1: Get the updated image

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/pushgateway:latest
```

### Step 2: Stop and backup the currently running container

Stop the currently running container using the command

```bash
$ docker stop pushgateway
```

Next, take a snapshot of the persistent volume `/path/to/pushgateway-persistence` using:

```bash
$ rsync -a /path/to/pushgateway-persistence /path/to/pushgateway-persistence.bkp.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H.%M.%S)
```

You can use this snapshot to restore the database state should the upgrade fail.

### Step 3: Remove the currently running container

```bash
$ docker rm -v pushgateway
```

### Step 4: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image, [restoring your backup](#restoring-a-backup) if necessary.

```bash
$ docker run --name pushgateway bitnami/pushgateway:latest
```
